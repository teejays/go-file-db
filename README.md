# GoFileDb
A basic schemaless implementation of a file system based DB client for Go. Developed while working for [Next Jump](https://www.nextjump.com).

There are a lot of reasons why a local file-system can and shall be used as a schemaless DB for micro projects. GoFileDb resembles a cache layer more than DB, since it doesn't have all the functionality that a DB would usually offer. GoFileDb works on the power of Get and Set methods.

## Installation Instructions
`go get https://github.com/teejays/gofiledb`
